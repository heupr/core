# Heupr&trade; Core

### Build well

## Description

This is the internal, private repository containing all relevant code for
the **Heupr** software suite. Various subdirectories will be made
available for open source use when deemed possible and will be established on
a case-by-case basis. Otherwise the code here is proprietary in nature and
should be treated as such.  

Code hosted on **GitHub** is the primary code base for the project. Updates
from the repository will be posted into the #github channel in **Slack**.  

Please see the [**Resources**](https://paper.dropbox.com/folder/show/Resources-e.iX7ZavGxujPFwhjOZcQrZyUA7J53cEHBMVaKLE8pXZDiAjjAQ5)
folder on **Dropbox Paper** for guidelines and development references.
